Explanation:
Creating the Dataset: The dictionary dict1 is defined with keys ‘Name’, ‘Marks’, and ‘Gender’.
Creating a DataFrame: The pandas DataFrame is created from the dictionary.
Top 3 Rows: The head(3) method is used to display the top 3 rows of the DataFrame.
Bottom 3 Rows: The tail(3) method is used to display the bottom 3 rows of the DataFrame.
Summary Statistics: The describe(include='all') method provides summary statistics for all columns, including count, unique values, top values, frequency, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.
Gender Count: The value_counts() method is used to count the occurrences of each gender.
Average Marks: The mean() method calculates the average marks.
